    "content": "オーストラリアのスーパーでは、鶏もも肉（chicken thigh）は簡単に買えます。骨なし（boneless）のものを選ぶと便利です。料理酒（sake）はアジア食材店で手に入りますが、なければ白ワインで代用できます。片栗粉は「corn starch」で探しましょう。\n\nシドニーのBondi Beach（ボンダイビーチ）はオーストラリアで一番有名なビーチの一つです。サーフィンをする人や散歩を楽しむ人で賑わっています。ビーチ沿いにはカジュアルなカフェがたくさんあり、テラスからオーシャンビューを楽しめます。\n\n唐揚げを揚げるときは、油の温度に気をつけましょう。シェアハウスで揚げ物をするときは、換気（ventilation）をしっかりして、油はねに注意してください。キッチンペーパーを多めに用意しておくと安心です。\n\nBondi Beachの近くには「Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk」という海沿いの遊歩道があります。ピンクや黄色の野花が咲く季節もあり、景色は最高です。ワーホリ中の息抜きに、唐揚げをお弁当に詰めてピクニックするのもおすすめです。"
