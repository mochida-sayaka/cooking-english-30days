    "content": "I went to Riverbank Jasmine Cafe in Bulimba last Wednesday. It was right next to the Brisbane River. I sat on the wooden deck and watched boats on the river. The air smelled like jasmine flowers. I ordered oyakodon and green tea. The chicken was soft and the egg was creamy. The rice was hot and fluffy. It was a simple but wonderful meal. I felt like I was in Japan."

    "content": "鶏もも肉（Chicken thigh）はオーストラリアのどのスーパーでも手に入ります。「Chicken thigh fillet」（骨なし）を選ぶと使いやすいです。卵（Eggs）は「free range eggs」（放し飼い）がおすすめで、味が濃くておいしいです。\n\nブリンバ（Bulimba）はブリスベンの川沿いにあるおしゃれな住宅街です。Oxford Streetにはカフェやブティックが並び、週末にはのんびり散歩を楽しむ人がたくさんいます。フェリーでシティから簡単にアクセスできます。\n\nワーホリ中の自炊で、親子丼はとてもおすすめです。材料が少なく、安く作れて、お腹がいっぱいになります。めんつゆ（Tsuyu）があれば、醤油・みりん・砂糖・だしの代わりに使えるので、さらに簡単です。アジア食材店で「Mentsuyu」を探してみましょう。\n\nブリンバの川沿いには、ジャスミンの花が咲く遊歩道があります。春になると甘い香りが漂い、とても気持ちがいいです。ピンクや黄色の花も多く、お気に入りの散歩コースになるかもしれません。"
