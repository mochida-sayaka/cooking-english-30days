    "content": "カツ丼に使う豚肉（pork loin）は、ColesやWoolworthsで簡単に買えます。パン粉（breadcrumbs）も普通のスーパーにありますが、日本式の粗いパン粉が欲しい場合はアジア食材店で「panko breadcrumbs」を探しましょう。最近はオーストラリアでも「panko」は人気です。\n\nバランガルー（Barangaroo）はシドニーの再開発エリアで、おしゃれなレストランやカフェがたくさんあります。ハーバーブリッジやオペラハウスが見える場所も多く、景色を楽しみながら食事ができます。\n\nワーホリ中に日本食レストランで働く人も多いです。カツ丼は人気メニューなので、「katsudon」「pork cutlet bowl」という英語を覚えておくと便利です。お客さんに料理を説明するときに使えますよ。\n\nカツ丼は日本では「勝つ」にかけて、試験やスポーツの前に食べる縁起物でもあります。ワーホリの面接や新しい仕事の前に、自分で作って食べるのもいいですね！"
