It was a wonderful evening."

    "title": "オーストラリアでたこ焼きを作るなら",
    "content": "たこ焼き器はオーストラリアではあまり売っていないので、日本から持っていくか、アジア食材店やネット通販（Amazon Australia）で探しましょう。電気式のたこ焼き器が便利です。\n\nタコ（octopus）は魚屋さん（fish shop）やスーパーの魚コーナーで「cooked octopus」として買えます。すでにゆでてあるものが多いので、そのまま切って使えます。だしの素（dashi powder）と紅しょうが（pickled ginger）はアジア食材店で手に入ります。\n\nWoolloongabbaはブリスベンの中心部に近いエリアです。おしゃれなカフェやレストランが増えていて、若い人に人気があります。週末にはマーケットが開かれることもあり、いろいろな国の料理が楽しめます。\n\nたこ焼きパーティーはオーストラリアの友達にとても人気です。みんなで焼く体験が楽しいからです。「Would you like to try making takoyaki?」と誘ってみましょう。きっと盛り上がりますよ。"
