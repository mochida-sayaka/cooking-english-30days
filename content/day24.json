I ordered hot udon with egg and fish cake. The noodles were thick and chewy. The soup was so warm and comforting. Soft jazz music was playing. It was a perfect rainy day lunch."

It smells so good!」と集まってきますよ。卵を落としたうどんは特に人気です。\n\nグリーブの近くにはウェントワースパークがあり、春にはミモザやジャスミンの花が咲きます。公園を散歩してから温かいうどんを食べるのは、オーストラリアでの素敵な休日の過ごし方です。"
