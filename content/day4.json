The chicken was crispy and the tartar sauce was rich and creamy. The sweet vinegar sauce was a little sour and very nice. The restaurant had warm lights and a cozy feeling. There were lavender flowers on each table. I loved this place very much."

    "content": "チキン南蛮に必要な材料は、ほぼオーストラリアのスーパーでそろいます。米酢（rice vinegar）はアジア食材コーナーにあります。なければ、白ワインビネガー（white wine vinegar）で代用できます。ピクルスは「pickles」や「gherkins」として瓶詰めで売られています。\n\nブリスベンのMount Coot-tha（マウントクーサ）は、市内から車で15分ほどの展望スポットです。山の上からブリスベンの街並みが一望でき、夜景もきれいです。展望台の近くにはカフェもあり、景色を眺めながらゆっくりお茶ができます。\n\nチキン南蛮はボリュームがあるので、ワーホリ中の食事にぴったりです。たくさん作って翌日のお弁当にするのもいいですね。タルタルソースは多めに作って冷蔵庫に入れておくと、サンドイッチにも使えて便利です。\n\nMount Coot-thaにはボタニカルガーデン（植物園）もあり、季節の花が楽しめます。ジャスミンやミモザの花も見られることがあります。休みの日にお弁当を持ってピクニックするのもおすすめです。ブリスベンは気候が良く、一年を通して外での食事が楽しめます。"
