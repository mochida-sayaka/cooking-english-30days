We ordered many yakitori sticks. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was perfect. We also had cold drinks. The lanterns on the terrace were so pretty. They had warm yellow light. We talked and laughed all night. It was a very fun time."

    "content": "オーストラリアでは鶏もも肉は「chicken thigh」として売っています。骨なしの「boneless chicken thigh」を選ぶと使いやすいです。オーストラリアの鶏肉はとても大きいので、日本より少ない枚数で十分です。\n\n竹串（bamboo skewers）はColesやWoolworthsのキッチン用品コーナーで買えます。焼く前に水に30分つけておくと、串が焦げにくくなります。\n\nオーストラリアではBBQ（バーベキュー）文化が盛んです。公園には無料で使えるBBQグリルがたくさんあります。友達と公園でBBQをする時に、焼き鳥を作ると「This is amazing!（すごい！）」と言われますよ。\n\nシドニーのSurry Hills（サリーヒルズ）は、おしゃれなバーやレストランが多い人気エリアです。金曜日の夜は特ににぎやかで、テラス席で食事を楽しむ人がたくさんいます。ワーホリ中のお出かけにぴったりです。"
